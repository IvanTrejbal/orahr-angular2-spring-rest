# orahr-angular2-spring-rest
This is a learning project - aim is to learn how to write __angular2__ application against __rest__ api
back-end. 
### our basic building blocks are
on the front-end:
 + angular2
 + prime ng components
 + ng2-restangular library
 
 on the back-end:
 + Spring Boot
 + Spring Data Rest  ( JPA, Hibernate )
 + Oracle Expres edition XE 
 
 The choice of database was done as a convenience - in installation of Express edition
 there is the HR schema ("Human resources") with 7 tables such as Employees, Jobs etc.. It is
 not as trivial as most examples found in tutorials and it is already filled with some data. 
 
For now the projects for "front end" and "back end" are completely separate.
